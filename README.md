**CGH40010F PA**

A 9.5 Watts (39.8 dbm) 2.4GHz power amplifier with greater than 50% PAE and +/- 100MHz bandwidth. The PA has a gain of >14db, an S11/S22 of <-15db and an IP3 point of >45dbm.

Gerber Files of a PA using the CGH40010F GaN HEMT transistor by Wolfspeed are provided. All components and voltage levels are noted in the pdf file.

**Important**: The design hasn't been tested yet. The measurments are from simulations in ADS by PathWave.
